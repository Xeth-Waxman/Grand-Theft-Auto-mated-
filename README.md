# Grand Theft Auto(mated)
 Using python 3 to play GTAV

 This project is based on the Python Plays GTAV tutorial located at https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/. This is going to be my attempt following along, making updates where necessary as libraries, packages, and models have evolved since the tutorial was written.
